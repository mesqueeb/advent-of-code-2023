# Advent of Code 2023

## Importing Task

To get the current days task (only in December)

```sh
node import.ts
```

You can run this again without it overwriting your previous index.ts, but it will update the readme (usually helpful for part 2).

You can also write `node import.ts <day>` to pull a specific day if you need to for some reason (e.g you missed a day)

```sh
node import.ts 1 # downloads day 1
```

## Running

Nothing fancy, to run day 1 do:

```sh
swift days/01/index.swift
```

Extrapolate for other days
